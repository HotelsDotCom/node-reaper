### Coding and pull request guidelines

* Make commits of logical and atomic units.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Make sure you have added a high level summary of your change (one line is usually enough) to the CHANGELOG.md in the root of the project.
* Run tests and packaging steps to assure nothing else was accidentally broken by running `make package`.
* Submit a pull request.
